# Visit Pollutri

Visit Pollutri is a site aiming to introduce to it's audience, a part of Italy mainly unknown by most. It introduces the Abruzzo region, and more specifically Pollutri, a village in the region which is like a small central hub, near to many other interesting sites. The target audience are those who want something different from the classic Toscana and Roma tourist destinations, and who want to experience Italy, without the negatives that popular tourist destinations suffer from. 

My hope is that the site will be useful to those people, by providing basic information about Pollutri, some information for attractions in the near area of Pollutri to get people going, and pictures which will start up their curiosity for the region and challenge them to explore more.
